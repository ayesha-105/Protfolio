# 🌟 Protfolio  

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my **digital space**.  
This repo holds the code for my **portfolio website** — a place where I bring together my projects, skills, and creativity.

## 🚀 Quick Glimpse  

✨ **Responsive design** — adapts beautifully to all screens.  
✨ **Clean & minimal UI** — no clutter, just focus.

✨ **Expandable projects page** — room to grow as I do.
